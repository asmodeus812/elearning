# Introduction

Spring boot is an open source java based framework used to create micro services, it is developed by Pivotal it is
easy to create a stand alone and production read spring application, using spring boo. Spring Boot enterprise ready
application that you can just run.

## Document Prerequisites

This introduction is written to developers and readers who already have experience with Java, Spring, Maven and
Gradle, you can easily understand the concepts of Spring Boot, if you have the aforementioned knowledge already. If
you are a beginner we suggest you to go through some resources which serve as introduction to the topics and
technologies mentioned above before you start reading this resource.

## Spring and Spring boot

There are two different concepts here, which are Spring and Spring Boot. What is the difference between these ? Spring
is the core framework, it consists of many components which are completely de-coupled from each other, they are
standalone components used in building systems, they can be composed and layered on top of each other to build complex
systems. However this requires a good amount of configuration to do, it is a complex process and it is more often than
not very common to build applications of the same type very often. Therefore the same amount of work has to be done
every time. This is where the Spring Boot comes in, the spring boot framework is also a list of components which are
simply Spring components that are pre-configured to work together. These components are usually represented by Gradle or
Maven dependencies, and to distinguish them from the regular spring components they are suffixed with the '-boot' work
in their name, they are nothing more than a collection of raw Spring components that are made to work together, but in
its core Spring Boot is simply just a well defined and configured common set of components for developing applications
on top of the core Spring framework where all the cruft and complexity is abstracted into

Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project by using
`@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation. For example, if MySQL database is on your `classpath`, but you have not
configured any database connection, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database. The entry point of the
spring boot application is the class contains `@SpringBootApplication` annotation and the main method. Spring Boot
automatically scans all the components included in the project by using `@ComponentScan` annotation.

As mentioned already all spring boot components contain the spring-boot name prefix, along with the starter word, which
is simply a way of marking a component as part of the spring-boot framework, and the starter signals that this component
is meant to be used as a bedrock for starting with the development, it should contain all the basics that one should
expect for the dependency to work with spring and all of its internal components, without requiring a massive amount of
user defined configuration to produce something useable

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Here is a general idea of what an entry point looks like in a spring boot application, where we have the following
annotation, `@SpringBootApplication`, this annotation alone is a combination of many other annotations, which are in
charge of constructing the initial context for running your application.

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

     public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
     }
}
```

# Modern guidelines

### 1. Use `record` for DTOs
- Auto-generates `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and getters.
- Immutable by design (no Lombok needed).
- Request/response DTOs (`@RequestBody`, `@ResponseBody`).
- Immutable configuration properties (`@ConfigurationProperties`).

```java
public class UserDto {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;
    // Boilerplate: constructor, getters, equals, hashCode, toString
}
```

```java
public record UserDto(String name, int age) { }
```

### 2. Prefer `var` for Local Variables (Judiciously)
- Use `var` when the type is obvious (e.g., `new` expressions, builders).
- Avoid `var` if it reduces readability (e.g., `var result = service.process()`).

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
```

```java
var names = new ArrayList<String>();
```

### 3. Replace Lombok with Java Language Features
- Use `record` for DTOs (replaces `@Data`, `@Value`).
- Use compact constructors:
- When to Keep Lombok:
  - `@Slf4j` (still concise).
  - `@Builder` (until Java gets a native builder pattern).

```java
@Data
@Builder
public class Product { ... }
```

```java
public record Product(String id, String name) {
    public Product {
        Objects.requireNonNull(id);
    }
}
```

### 4. Sealed Classes for Domain Models
- Explicitly restricts inheritance (better domain modeling).
- Works great with Spring Data JPA `@Entity` hierarchies.

```java
public abstract class Shape { ... }
public class Circle extends Shape { ... }  // Unlimited extensibility
```

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle { ... }
```

### 5. Pattern Matching (`instanceof` and `switch`)
- Cleaner controller logic (e.g., handling polymorphic DTOs).

```java
if (obj instanceof String) {
    String s = (String) obj;
    System.out.println(s.length());
}
```

```java
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.length());
}
```

### 6. Text Blocks for JSON/HTML/SQL
- `@Sql` annotations in internal tests.
- Hardcoded API response examples.

```java
String json = "{\"name\":\"John\", \"age\":30}";
```

```java
String json = """
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30
    }
    """;
```

### 7. Null Checks with `Objects.requireNonNullElse`

```java
return name != null ? name : "default";
```

```java
return Objects.requireNonNullElse(name, "default");
```

### 8. HTTP Interface Clients (Java 21+)
- No need for `@FeignClient` (standard Java interface).

```java
@FeignClient(url = "https://api.example.com")
public interface UserClient {
    @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
    User getUser(@PathVariable String id);
}
```

```java
public interface UserClient {
    @GetExchange("/users/{id}")
    User getUser(String id);
}
```

### 9. Avoid `@Autowired` use Constructor Injection Only
- Immutable dependencies (thread-safe, no Lombok `@RequiredArgsConstructor` needed).

```java
@Autowired
private UserService userService;
```

```java
private final UserService userService;

public UserController(UserService userService) {
    this.userService = userService;
}
```

### 10. Switch Expressions

```java
switch (status) {
    case "OK": return 200;
    case "BAD": return 400;
    default: return 500;
}
```

```java
return switch (status) {
    case "OK" -> 200;
    case "BAD" -> 400;
    default -> 500;
};
```

# Getting started

This section will teach you how to create a Spring Boot application using Maven and Gradle.

## Command line interface

The Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool and it allows us to run the Groovy scripts. This is the easiest way to create
a Spring Boot application by using the Spring Boot Command Line Interface. You can create, run and test the application
in command prompt itself.

The spring cli has a neat way to generate projects, by simply providing the name of the project and some build and
project arguments one can build any type of project skeleton very quickly, with the required set of dependencies and
build environment conditions. This is mostly applicable for Maven and Gradle projects.

```sh
# this would build a very simple maven project skeleton, that would only include the basic spring boot starter and
# starter test dependencies and simple pom file for the maven project, as specified in the command below
$ spring init spring-boot --java-version=17 --build=maven
```

```sh
# here is the list, heavily abridged for demonstration purposes, that lists what are the supported dependencies, project
# types and, different project parameters one can pass to the spring cli to construct a project skeleton
$ spring init --list

```

## Getting started

Spring boot provides a number of starters to add the jars in our class paths, for example for writing a rest endpoint we
end to add the spring-boot-starter-web dependency in our class path. Observe the codes shown below for a better
understanding.

The main method should be writing the Spring Boot Application class. This class should be annotated with the
`SpringBootApplication` annotation, this is the entry point for the spring boot application to start, you can find the
main class file under the src/java/main path / directory


Now to write a simple Hello World Rest endpoint in the spring boot application main class file itself, follow the steps shown below:

- Firstly, add the `RestControoller` annotation at the top of the class
- Now, write a request URI method with the `RequestMethod` annotation
- Then the request URI method should return the Hello World string

```java
package com.tutorialspoint.demo;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

    @RequestMapping(value="/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
```

## Packaging application

Creating an executable JAR. Let us create and executable JAR file to run the Spring Boot Application, by using Maven or
Gradle. The Spring executable JAR is somewhat different than regular JAR files which one can execute, the Spring `JARs`
are meant to be self containing, they bundle the actual web server that is used to run the application, which could be a
small web server like Tomcat, then on top of that all other dependencies are included into the jar. Unlike regular JARs
(which only contain your classes in `/`), a Spring Boot executable JAR has:

First make sure that the maven plugin that is responsible for packaging the spring application is included into your pom
file, we are not going to be using the regular maven package plugin - `maven-jar-plugin`

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>
</parent>
```

```
BOOT-INF/
    ├── classes/      # Your compiled application classes
    ├── lib/          # All dependency JARs
META-INF/
    ├── MANIFEST.MF   # Defines the launcher class
org/springframework/boot/loader/
    ├── JarLauncher.class  # Spring Boot's custom launcher
```

- Spring Boot uses `JarLauncher` (from `spring-boot-loader`) to **bootstrap** the application.
- This launcher knows how to load classes from `BOOT-INF/classes` and `BOOT-INF/lib`, unlike the standard Java classloader.
- All dependencies are **embedded** in the JAR (no need for an external `lib` folder).
- Avoids `classpath` issues when deploying.

How does it work ? If we compare the standard jar packaging plugin provided by maven to the spring one. The Standard
maven plugin would package the JAR without including the dependencies or libraries that our project depends on, just the
compiled classes for our project, the structure of a standard jar might look something like that

```
your-app.jar
├── META-INF/
│   └── MANIFEST.MF       # Basic metadata (Main-Class points directly to your app)
├── com/
│   └── yourpackage/      # Your compiled classes
└── (No dependencies!)    # Requires external `lib/*.jar` files
```

Meaning we have no embedded dependencies included, and we have no embedded server included in the final JAR, that means
that these have to be provided manually, that works if we are trying to deploy on an already existing web server, which
presumable would have these dependencies installed. There are many ways to run a jar without its dependencies, but the
most common one is to simply add those to the classpath, meaning that we have to build the command `java -jar` to
include the required dependencies along with the jar we are trying to execute, this could be useful on systems where
many jars are deployed on a single web server, and the dependencies are shared across the jars for the most part. This
is how it is done in monolithic systems where micro services are not deployed.

```sh
# first we copy all the dependencies into a common directory, which would then be passed to the java cp command, note
# that we are using shell expansion here, the target/lib/*, is shell specific and the shell itself would expand all the
# jars in the lib folder when running the command, this is not something that is done or understood by the java binary,
mkdir -p target/lib && cp myapp.jar target/lig
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=target/lib
java -cp "target/your-app.jar:target/lib/*" com.myapp.MainClass
```

Note that we are passing the entire classpath to the JVM, above, we are not using `java -jar` that is because that
command expects the jar to have a valid MANIFEST file, which the jar compiled and packaged by default from the
maven-jar-plugin does not. We are going to leverage another plugin called the assembly plugin to do exactly that - build
a MANIFEST file into the jar which will be read by the JVM to construct the classpath based on the contents of that file

There are also other ways to do this by configuring the maven plugin to package these libraries for you while the jar is
being built, this is what the spring boot plugin does actually it would put a lib/ folder with the libraries and
dependencies directly into the jar. Which is effectively the same as passing it on the classpath. Here is an example of
how you can package the jar using the assembly plugin which would effectively do what we discussed

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <descriptorRefs>
            <descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
        </descriptorRefs>
        <archive>
            <!-- Here is the config for the MANIFEST file that will be constructed and put into the jar -->
            <manifest>
                <mainClass>com.yourpackage.MainClass</mainClass>
            </manifest>
        </archive>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>single</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

```sh
# after the assembly plugin has done its job, we would have a jar file which can be simply run like so, which is pretty
# much the same way we run the spring jars as well, since your jar would now contain the MANIFEST file, which described
# how to construct the classpath and where to find all the libraries and dependencies required
$ java -jar app.jar
```

So how does the spring boot maven plugin package the jar and how does it run, the following steps are being followed to
execute this process:

1. **We start by running the jar**:
   ```sh
   $ java -jar your-app.jar
   ```

2. **Java virtual machine reads `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`**:

   ```plaintext
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: Maven JAR Plugin 3.4.2
    Build-Jdk-Spec: 17
    Implementation-Title: demo
    Implementation-Version: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.launch.JarLauncher
    Start-Class: com.spring.demo.DemoApplication
    Spring-Boot-Version: 3.5.3
    Spring-Boot-Classes: BOOT-INF/classes/
    Spring-Boot-Lib: BOOT-INF/lib/
    Spring-Boot-Classpath-Index: BOOT-INF/classpath.idx
    Spring-Boot-Layers-Index: BOOT-INF/layers.idx
   ```

3. **`JarLauncher` takes over**:
   - Sets up a **custom classloader** to load classes from:
     - `BOOT-INF/classes/` (your code).
     - `BOOT-INF/lib/*.jar` (dependencies).
   - Discovers and launches the `Start-Class` (your `@SpringBootApplication` class).

4. **Spring Boot initializes**:
   - Starts the embedded server (if applicable).
   - Autoconfigures beans, initialize the context, etc.

So if we want to really compare both here is what we have established so far, the main differences between the
maven-jar-plugin and the spring-boot-maven-plugin.

| Feature                | `maven-jar-plugin`                  | `spring-boot-maven-plugin`          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Dependencies**       | Not included (external `lib/`)      | Embedded in `BOOT-INF/lib/`         |
| **Main-Class**         | Directly points to your class       | Delegates to `JarLauncher`          |
| **Class Loading**      | Standard JVM classloader            | Custom `LaunchedURLClassLoader`     |
| **Runnable**           | Requires manual classpath setup     | Works with `java -jar`              |
| **Web Server**         | Needs external Tomcat/Jetty         | Embedded server (Tomcat/Netty/etc.) |

There is another type of JAR archive, called a WAR application, this is another type of JAR that is deployed on a web
server, unlike the JAR file, the WAR has a different format and specification this is because the web server where this
WAR will be deployed requires a specific format and structure to be present.

A **WAR** is a specialized JAR used for **web applications** (e.g., Servlet-based apps like Spring MVC). It follows a
strict structure defined by the `Java EE/Jakarta EE` spec and is deployed to **external servers** (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty,
WildFly).

```plaintext
my-app.war
├── WEB-INF/
│   ├── classes/       # Your compiled classes (e.g., `com.yourpackage`)
│   ├── lib/           # Dependency JARs (external to the WAR)
│   └── web.xml        # Servlet configuration (optional in modern apps)
├── META-INF/          # Metadata (e.g., context info)
└── static/            # Static files (HTML, JS, CSS)
```

Requires a Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat). The dependencies in `WEB-INF/lib/` are loaded by the server, and there is no main
class, the server starts the app (not `java -jar`).

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.0</version>
</plugin>
```

To setup and deploy the application you can simply do

```sh
$ mvn clean package  # Generates `target/my-app.war`
$ cp target/my-app.war /opt/tomcat/webapps/
# Tomcat unpacks the WAR and starts the app.
```

To be able to share common libraries, we can use the special directory that tomcat checks, where we can Place common
JARs (e.g., Spring, Hibernate, JDBC drivers) in the server’s `lib/` folder. All deployed WARs automatically inherit
these JARs in their classpath.

```plaintext
/opt/tomcat/lib/
├── spring-core.jar
├── hibernate-core.jar
└── postgresql-driver.jar
```

We can also make sure to exclude the dependency from the final archive, by setting the provided property on the scope
tag, this will signal the maven builder that this dependency must not be packaged in, and it will be `provided` by an
external party, in this case it will be the web server - tomcat in our example.

```xml
<project>
  <packaging>war</packaging>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- Mark shared dependencies as 'provided' -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
      <version>6.1.0</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>  <!-- Server will supply this -->
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
```

WARs can **omit libraries** if the server provides them centrally (via `lib/` or `shared/lib/`). This is common in
traditional Java EE deployments but sacrifices version flexibility. Modern apps (especially Spring Boot) prefer
**self-contained JARs** to avoid conflicts, and it is much harder to setup a micro service environment where the web
server is separately deployed from the application, and the web server has the common dependencies already installed.
This is more suitable for monolithic applications where there are centralized servers installed on big fat environments,
and they can be pre-loaded with all the common dependencies marked as provided in the pom file of the application.

To understand it better, here are the different types of scopes that maven allows you to specify for a dependency, you can
certainly see that there are different use cases, and in most use cases, we are either going to be using runtime,
compiled or provided. For an embedded server, the most common one will be the compile one, since all the libraries must
be present at compile time into the JAR, for WAR types we might make use of a lot of provided dependencies such as Tomcat
shared implementation libraries that are going to be provided by the web server by default

| Scope      | Compile | Test | Runtime | Packaged | Example Use Case                |
|------------|---------|------|---------|----------|----------------------------------|
| `compile`  | ✅      | ✅   | ✅      | ✅       | Spring, Hibernate                |
| `provided` | ✅      | ✅   | ❌      | ❌       | Servlet API, Tomcat-shared libs  |
| `runtime`  | ❌      | ✅   | ✅      | ✅       | JDBC drivers                     |
| `test`     | ❌      | ✅   | ❌      | ❌       | JUnit, Mockito                   |
| `system`   | ✅      | ✅   | ❌      | ❌       | Avoid (non-portable JARs)        |
| `import`   | ❌      | ❌   | ❌      | ❌       | BOMs for dependency management   |

1. **`compile` (Default)**
   - Available in all phases (compile, test, runtime).
   - Packaged in the final JAR/WAR.
   - **Example**: `spring-core` (needed at runtime).

3. **`runtime`**
   - Not needed for compilation, but required at runtime.
   - Packaged in the final artifact.
   - **Example**: `mysql-connector-java` (loaded dynamically).

2. **`provided`**
   - Available during compilation and testing, but **not packaged**.
   - Assumed to be provided by the runtime (e.g., a server).
   - **Example**: `javax.servlet-api` (provided by Tomcat).

5. **`system`** (Avoid if possible)
   - Like `provided`, but points to a local JAR file.
   - **Example**: Rarely used (non-portable).

6. **`import`** (Special case)
   - Used in `<dependencyManagement>` to inherit versions from another POM.
   - **Example**: `spring-boot-dependencies` (BOM files).

4. **`test`**
   - Only available during testing (`src/test`).
   - Never packaged.
   - **Example**: `junit` (test-only dependency).

## Build system

In Spring Boot, choosing a build system is an important task. We recommend Maven or Gradle as they provide a good
support for dependency management. Spring does not support well other build systems.

Spring Boot team provides a list of dependencies to support the Spring Boot version for its every release. You do not
need to provide a version for dependencies in the build configuration file. Spring Boot automatically configures the
dependencies version based on the release. Remember that when you upgrade the Spring Boot version, dependencies also
will upgrade automatically. This is achieved by the parent BOM spring dependency which you specify, the BOM - which
stands for bill of materials, is a set of pre-defined list of dependencies. The spring BOM has a version, which carries
with it the correct combination of all spring dependency versions.

## Best practices

Spring Boot does not have any code layout to work with. However, there are some best practices that will help us. This
chapter talks about them in detail.

### Default packages

A class that does not have any package declaration is considered as a **default package**. Note that generally a default
package declaration is not recommended. Spring Boot will cause issues such as malfunctioning of Auto Configuration or
Component Scan, when you use default package.

### Typical layout

It is generally accepted that at the root name of the artifact id for the project - `com.myapp.project`, we should have
the Application.java file, which contains the Main class, this is due to the fact that any class annotated with the
`@SpringBootApplication` annotation, will serve as entry point for scanning the packages and beans under it, in that case
if we put the main class at `com.myapp.project`, then everything under this root package name will be considered for
injection by the spring components.

### Auto-configuration

As mentioned in spring we have a concept called an Auto configuration, this is a process by which spring picks specific
pre-defined beans on the class path. The way it works is by defining a special type of file that contains the full path
to the class that is considered to be the auto-configuration class, this file is called the
`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports`, this file contains lines of text which define the
different classes spring autoconfigure should consider when starting the application, this is different compared to
classes annotated with @Configuration, which we will talk about later.

Here is the abridged version of the file included in the `META-INF/spring/` folder in the autoconfigure dependency, this
file is automatically picked when we define the `EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation on a spring project, then each of
those classes will be instantiated and their methods run.

```imports
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.admin.SpringApplicationAdminJmxAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.amqp.RabbitAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.aop.AopAutoConfiguration
............................................................................................
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.websocket.reactive.WebSocketReactiveAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.websocket.servlet.WebSocketMessagingAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.websocket.servlet.WebSocketServletAutoConfiguration
```

It is prudent to note that you can also create your own imports file, by simply putting in tin the src/main/resources
folder of your own library of project, then when it gets built it will be put into the META-INF folder in your final
JAR, that file will then be looked up by the spring autoconfigure library. Create the file into the resources directory
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports`: Loaded
**automatically** when the JAR is on the classpath, and no `scanBasePackages` required.

```plaintext
com.yourlib.autoconfig.CustomSecurityAutoConfig
```

```java
package com.yourlib.autoconfig;

@Configuration
@ConditionalOnClass(SomeDependency.class)
public class CustomSecurityAutoConfig { ... }
```

On another hand we have the @Configuration annotation, that is a bit different since it is discovered through component
scanning, which is a different process in spring, it also occurs in a different stage of the application startup
process, this is later than the auto configuration classes as well. They are loaded if these fall under the scan base
packages list, i.e. the class is in a package scanned by Spring (`com.yourpackage`), or explicitly imported with the
annotation - `@Import(AppConfig.class)`.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() { return new MyService(); }
}
```

`In the end the result of both is the same, both types of classes are defined using the same annotations, and the same
rules, the only difference is that the spring provided auto configurations are mostly located in the starter packages,
which spring provides, and are defined in the imports file, in theory if you remove the imports file, and put the spring
org.srpingboot base package in the scanBasePackages annotation value of ComponentScan, you will achieve the same effect,
the only difference is that the configurations defined in the imports file are run earlier than the component scanning
that spring does on the classes under packages defined in scanBasePackages, but that still happens after the spring
context is initialized`

The general rule of thumb, is that if you are creating a library or re-usable component it is easier and cleaner to
provide your own imports file, this would avoid having your package's users or clients to have to include the base
package of your library or component every time into the `ComponentScan.scanBasePackages annotation`.

## Application properties

Application Properties support us to work in different environments. In this section, you are going to see how to
configure and specify the properties to a Spring Boot application.

The general order of properties collection that Spring Boot does is by evaluating sources in this order (higher
overrides lower order):

1. **Command-line arguments** (`--key=value`, directly run the application with these properties).
2. **`SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`** (environment variable with JSON properties, not a file location).
3. **`JNDI`** (Java Naming and Directory Interface).
4. **Externalized files** (`--spring.config.location`).
5. **Environment YAML/properties** (e.g., `application-prod.yml`).
6. **Default files `application.yml`/`application.properties`**.

Here an example of implementing the different types of property overrides when working with a spring application, also
defined in order of most precedence to the least precedence.

1. **Command-line arguments** (`--key=value` in `java -jar`).
   ```sh
   java -jar app.jar --server.port=8081
   ```

2. **Environment variables** (e.g., `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `SERVER_PORT`).
   ```sh
   export SERVER_PORT=8081
   ```

3. **System properties** (`-Dkey=value` passed to JVM).
   ```sh
   java -Dserver.port=8081 -jar app.jar
   ```

4. **Profile-specific YAML/properties** (e.g., `application-prod.yml`).

5. **Default `application.yml`/`application.properties`**.
### Command line

Spring Boot application converts the command line properties into Spring Boot Environment properties. Command line
properties take precedence over the other property sources. By default, Spring Boot uses the 8080 port number to start
the Tomcat. Let us learn how change the port number by using command line properties. There are a few ways to override
certain properties on the command line, such that they will take precedence over the ones with which the app was packaged

```sh
# Values will override any `server.port` or `spring.datasource.url` defined in `application.yml`.
$ java -jar your-app.jar --server.port=8081 --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb

# Properties in `custom-config.yml` will **override** those in `application.yml`.
# Add `classpath:` for files in the classpath (e.g., `classpath:override.properties`).
$ java -jar your-app.jar --spring.config.location=file:/path/to/custom-config.yml

# Merge additional files without replacing the packaged `application.yml`:
$ java -jar your-app.jar --spring.config.additional-location=file:/path/to/extra.properties
```

### Environment

There are several ways to override the properties through the environment,

#### Core Spring Boot Variables

| Env Variable                     | Effect                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`        | Injects properties as JSON (e.g., `{"server":{"port":8081}}`).        |
| `SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION`         | Overrides config file path (e.g., `file:/config/override.yml`).       |
| `SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL_LOCATION` | Adds extra config files without replacing defaults.                  |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`         | Sets active profiles (e.g., `prod,debug`).                            |
| `SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_ENABLED`    | Disables/configures Spring Cloud Config (e.g., `false`).              |


#### Logging and Debugging

| Env Variable             | Effect                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEBUG`                  | Enables debug logs if set to `true` or `1`.                           |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT`      | Sets root log level (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`).                          |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL_org.springframework.web` | Sets package-specific logging (e.g., `DEBUG`).              |
| `SPRING_OUTPUT_ANSI_ENABLED` | Force ANSI color output (e.g., `ALWAYS`).                         |

#### Server and Database Overrides

| Env Variable                     | Effect                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SERVER_PORT`                    | Overrides `server.port` (e.g., `8081`).                               |
| `SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXT_PATH`    | Sets the context path (e.g., `/api`).                                 |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`          | Overrides DB URL (e.g., `jdbc:mysql://db:3306/app`).                  |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`     | Sets DB username.                                                     |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`     | Sets DB password.                                                     |


Replace `.` with `_` and uppercase (e.g., `server.port` → `SERVER_PORT`). Nested keys: `spring.datasource.url` →
`SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`.

#### Overriding with `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`

If you can’t use Spring-specific vars, pass the Java system properties, which will be picked up by spring, since it does
a lookup in order of environment variables, system variables, and then proceeds with startup arguments

```sh
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Dserver.port=8081 -Ddebug=true"
```

### Properties file

Properties files are used to keep 'N' number of properties in a single file to run the application in a different
environment. In Spring Boot, properties are kept in the **application.[properties/yml]** files under the classpath. The
application.properties file is located in the **src/main/resources** directory. The code for sample
**application.properties** and the **application.yml** file are given below:

```properties
server.port=9090
spring.application.name=demoservice
```

```yml
spring:
 application:
    name: demo
server:
 port: 8080
```

### Value annotation

The @Value annotation is used to read the environment or application property value in Java code. The syntax to read the
property value is shown below:

```java
@Value("${spring.application.name}")
private String applicationName;
```

## Spring Profiles

Spring boot supports different properties based on the Spring active profile. For example we can keep two separate files
for development and production to run the Spring Boot application, or we can also use multi-document setup in the same
file, in a regular yml file it is possible to separate different documents using the `---` atom, which is the
equivalent of having different / separate files.

```yml
---
# make sure that the logging is active for all profiles by default, we are using the INFO level, which means that we
# will be logging everything above and including INFO level, that implies - INFO, WARN, ERROR.
logging:
  level:
    com.spring.demo.core: INFO

# this is the base document, or the default one which will be picked up by spring, anything defined here can be
# overridden with specific active profile configuration
spring:
  application:
    name: demo-base

---
spring:
  application:
    name: demo-local
  config:
    activate:
      # this tells spring that this document will be only active if the current profile that is active is called `local`, in
      # that case this file / document will be merged with the base config
      on-profile:
      - local
---
```

The other traditional option that spring provides is separate files, each file has to include the name of the active
profile in its name - `application, application-local, application-dev`, where the active properties will be, respectively
in order - the profiles `default , local and dev`. The default profile is always active.

While running the JAR file, we need to specify the spring active profile based on each properties file. By default,
Spring Boot application uses the application.properties file. The command to set the spring active profile is shown
below:

```sh
$ java -jar <demo-application>.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
```

```plaintext
2017-11-26 08:13:16.322 INFO 14028 --- [ main]
com.tutorialspoint.demo.DemoApplication : The following profiles are active:
dev
```

## Spring Logging

Spring Boot uses Apache Commons logging for all internal logging. Spring Boot's default configurations provides a
support for the use of Java Util Logging, Log4j2, and Logback. Using these, we can configure the console logging as well
as file logging.

If you are using Spring Boot Starters, Logback will provide a good support for logging. Besides, Logback also provides a
use of good support for Common Logging, Util Logging, Log4J, and SLF4J.

The default log messages will print to the console window. By default, "INFO", "ERROR" and "WARN" log messages will
print in the log file.

```plaintext
[INFO] +- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-logging:jar:3.5.3:compile
[INFO] |  +- ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:jar:1.5.18:compile
[INFO] |  |  +- ch.qos.logback:logback-core:jar:1.5.18:compile
[INFO] |  |  \- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:2.0.17:compile
[INFO] |  +- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j:jar:2.24.3:compile
[INFO] |  |  \- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:jar:2.24.3:compile
[INFO] |  \- org.slf4j:jul-to-slf4j:jar:2.0.17:compile
```

### SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)

- **Role**: Abstraction layer (facade) over concrete logging implementations.
- **Purpose**: Decouples your code from specific logging frameworks.
  - Provides a unified API (e.g., `LoggerFactory.getLogger()`).
  - Allows switching implementations (Logback, Log4j2, etc.) without code changes.

### Logback
- **Default in Spring Boot**.
  - Native SLF4J implementation (no adapter needed).
  - Fast, flexible configuration via `logback.xml`.

### Log4j2
- **Successor to Log4j 1.x**.
- **Strengths**:
  - High performance (asynchronous logging).
  - Advanced features (JSON/YAML config, plugins).

### java.util.logging (JUL)
- **Built into the JVM**.
  - Limited features, poor performance.
  - Rarely used directly (SLF4J bridges exist).

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class); // SLF4J API
logger.info("Hello"); // Delegates to the implementation Logback/Log4j2
```

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId> <!-- Logback -->
</dependency>
```

To use the `log4j2` Replace the starter dependency with `spring-boot-starter-log4j2`.

By default, all logs will print on the console window and not in the files. If you want to print the logs in a file, you
need to set the property **logging.file** or **logging.path** in the application.properties file.

You can specify the log file path using the property shown below. Note that the log file name is spring.log.

```yml
# we have to provide the name of the log file, and path, by default these values are not set, thus no file logging is
# performed but it is a good practice in production to make sure both are explicitly provided, and have a persistent log location,
# note that this is using a relative path, the file will be created in the current working directory where the jar was run, the
# reason being is that depending on your system, paths like /tmp or /var might not be accessible to the process running the jar,
# and the log file will never be created, so make sure that your process has the permissions to read/write at the file.path location
logging.file.path=./tmp/
logging.file.name=spring.log
```

To modify the log levels, for all packages we can use the `root` prefix, this will enable logging levels for every
package in the classpath, however it is possible to provide a more granular logging based on a specific package or even
an entire sub-package.

```yml
logging:
    level:
        root=ERROR
        com.my.package=TRACE
        org.springframework.web: DEBUG
        org.hibernate.SQL: DEBUG
        org.hibernate.type: TRACE
```

## Usage example

Here is a more advanced and complete example using the different options we have looked at such as logging,
configurations, properties and injection

```java
package com.spring.demo.config;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class DefaultDemoAutoConfiguration {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DefaultDemoAutoConfiguration.class);

    public DefaultDemoAutoConfiguration() {
        LOGGER.info("Creating the auto configuration bean DefaultDemoAutoConfiguration");
    }

    @Bean
    DefaultAutoConfigBean defaultBeanFromAutoConfig(@Value("${spring.application.name}") String name) {
        LOGGER.info("Initializing DefaultAutoConfigBean");
        return new DefaultAutoConfigBean(name);
    }

    public static final class DefaultAutoConfigBean {

        public DefaultAutoConfigBean(String name) {
            LOGGER.info("Running DefaultAutoConfigBean constructor for {}", name);
        }
    }
}
```

# Restful services

Before you proceed to build a RESTful web service, it is suggested that you have knowledge of the following annotations:
The `@RestController` annotation is used to define the RESTful web services. It serves JSON, XML and custom response. Its
syntax is shown below:

```java
@RestController
public class ProductServiceController {
}
```

## Request Mapping

The `@RequestMapping` annotation is used to define the Request URI to access the REST Endpoints. We can define Request
method to consume and produce object. The default request method is GET. However the annotation itself has a field that
can be used to specify the type - GET, POST, DELETE etc. All major METHOD types are supported out of the box. There are
dedicated annotations which are called `PostMapping`, `GetMapping`, `DeleteMapping` and so forth, which are preferred over the
plain direct usage of the `RequestMapping` annotation

```java
@RequestMapping(value="/products")
public ResponseEntity<Object> getProducts() { }
```

## Request Body

The `@RequestBody` annotation is used to define the request body content type. This is relevant when the request method
in question is of type that is different than GET, in those cases it is possible to send payload to the Servlet. The
payload in this case will be automatically de-serialized into the Product POJO, however if there are types mismatch
present between the types of the fields or properties of the Product POJO then an error would be thrown.

```java
@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.POST, value="/products")
public ResponseEntity<Object> createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
}
```

This example shows how we can read in an ambiguous set of values and fields from the request instead of having a
dedicated java class that defines the fields, this is possible due to the usage of the Object in the map which is
polymorphic at runtime. The de-serialized values in the Map would Object instances, but actually be de-serialized values
of class primitives such as Integer, String, Byte, Boolean etc.

```java
@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.POST, value="/products2")
public ResponseEntity<Object> createProductMap(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> product) {
}
```

## Path Variable

The `@PathVariable` annotation is used to define the custom or dynamic request URI. The Path variable in request URI is
defined as curly braces {} as shown below. This would inject the value of the templated entry in the path string in this
case called {id} into the method argument, when the request is received, which would allow you to dynamically read a
request value from the path. Take a good note of the name of the argument in the annotation - `id`, this has to match
the value in the brackets. It is also possible to skip the value in the `@PathVariable` annotation, and the name would
be inferred from the name of the argument of the function, this however is only possible if the jar is compiled with the
-parameter option passed to the compiler, that would tell the compiler to retain the name of the arguments at runtime,
making them accessible to the annotation processor that injects the value into the arguments of the function, by reading
their names

```java
@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET, value="/products/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Object> updateProduct(@PathVariable("id") String id) {
}
```

## Request Parameter

The `@RequestParam` annotation is used to read the request parameters from the Request URL. By default, it is a required
parameter. We can also set default value for request parameters as shown here:

```java
// one would be able to call this GET endpoint such as follows schema://hostname/products?name=product-name, the query
// parameter is optional meaning that a call will match without it being present, and a value will be defined by default if
// there is no value provided
@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET, value="/products")
public ResponseEntity<Object> getProduct(@RequestParam(value="name", required=false, defaultValue="honey") String name) {
}
```

## Request Header

While a request is being built by the client it is possible to construct a custom header that can be passed in the
header section of the HTTP payload, this header has a name and a value, in our case the name is `x-product-name` note
that the header names are **`not case sensitive`**, the values in there are usually primitive strings, numbers or
boolean types.

```java
@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET, value="/products")
public ResponseEntity<Object> getProduct(@RequestHeader("X-Product-Name") String name) {
}
```

## Request Attribute

The request attribute, is an internal construct that is attached to the request by the Servlet processor, as early as
the request being captured by the web server, usually in the real world a special filter or interceptor might add some
request attribute to the request before it reaches the method call in the restful controller, this can then be used to
do some further processing, this usually can happen based on some business logic, or in the example below, based on some
other properties found in the http request sent by the client.

```java
// based on some business logic a special attribute might be added to the request before it reaches the controller method
// in our example we `imagine` that a special discount value will be added based on some heuristic calculated from the
// client request payload.
@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET, value="/products")
public ResponseEntity<AuditLog> getProducts(@RequestAttribute("discount") Double discount) {
}
```

## Controller example

```java
@RestController
public class ProductsController {

    @PostMapping("/products-body")
    public ResponseEntity<Object> getProductsQuery(@RequestBody ProductResourceRecord product) {
        return ResponseEntity.of(Optional.ofNullable(product));
    }

    @GetMapping("/products-header")
    public ResponseEntity<Object> getProductsHeader(@RequestHeader("name") String name) {
        return ResponseEntity.of(Optional.ofNullable(name));
    }

    @GetMapping("/products-query")
    public ResponseEntity<Object> getProductsQuery(@RequestParam("name") String name) {
        return ResponseEntity.of(Optional.ofNullable(name));
    }

    @GetMapping("/products-path/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Object> getProductsPath(@PathVariable("id") String id) {
        return ResponseEntity.of(Optional.ofNullable(id));
    }

    @GetMapping("/products-discount")
    public ResponseEntity<Object> getProductsDiscount(@RequestAttribute("discount") Double discount) {
        return ResponseEntity.of(Optional.ofNullable(discount));
    }
}
```

```http
### 1. POST with @RequestBody
POST http://localhost:8080/products-body
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "laptop",
    "name": "Laptop",
}

### 2. GET with @RequestHeader
GET http://localhost:8080/products-header
name: PremiumCustomer

### 3. GET with @RequestParam
GET http://localhost:8080/products-query?name=Smartphone

### 4. GET with @PathVariable
GET http://localhost:8080/products-path/12345

### 5. GET with @RequestAttribute (requires server-side setup)
GET http://localhost:8080/products-discount
```

# Handling exceptions

Handling exceptions and errors in API, and sending the proper responses to the client is good for enterprise
application, in this chapter we will learn how to handle the exceptions in spring boot, before proceeding with exception
handling let us gain an understanding on the following annotations:

## @ControllerAdvice

This annotation is used to handle the exceptions globally. What it does it create an advice - an advice is a type of
functionality that is wrapped around a certain functionality, when you a controller method is triggered, a certain code
can be executed before or after or around the execution of this method.

```java
public ResponseEntity<Object> getProducts() {}
```

If we assume we have this method present in our controller, the Advice can be called right before the method is called,
right after the method exits or/and both could be done as well. Meaning that we can do some generic work before or/and
after the method execution.

In the most general use case that can be used to catch exceptions in a single location no mater which controller method
was called. This is useful when used in conjunction with the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation.

## @ExceptionHandler

This annotation is used to handle the specific exceptions, what it does is annotate a method inside a class annotated
with `@ControllerAdvice`, that method will be called when a specific exception of a specific type is emitted from a
controller method.

The advice is usually implemented internally with a library like `aspectj`, which allows us to inject at either runtime
(through a proxy object) or compile time (by literally writing byte code during compile time) additional code around a
certain construct like - method, constructor etc. The `ControllerAdvice` and the `ExceptionHandler` are provided by Spring
to simplify the process.

```java
// we create an advice for controllers, this annotation will pick up this class and create an advice handler wrapped
// around all methods in classes marked with RestController in our module, it could look something like that, in pseudo code:
// try {
//     return productController.getProducts();
// } catch(Throwable e) {
//     for handler in handlers {
//         if e instanceOf handler.getException() {
//             handler.executeExceptionHandlerMethod();
//         }
//     }
// }
@ControllerAdvice
public class ProductExceptionController {

    @ExceptionHandler(value = ProductNotfoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<Object> exception(ProductNotfoundException exception) {
        // handle the specific exception, if another exception is triggered this method will not be called, the
        // ExceptionHandler specifically handles only this type of exception and ignores others, if you wish to be more
        // generic you could create another method, annotated with - @ExceptionHandler(value = RuntimeException.class)
    }
}
```
