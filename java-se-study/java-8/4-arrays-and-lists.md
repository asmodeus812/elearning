## Arrays

Basic declaration of an array is of the form `type var-name[]` while to define one we have to also initialize it to an
object in memory such as `var-name = new type[size]`.

```java
    int integers[];
    integers = new int[100]; // create an array of 100 primitives and assign the object reference to `integers`
```

Initialization lists for arrays, are represented as elements surrounded by curly braces, compared to String literals
however the Initialization lists are not interned, meaning that no special pool is created, if we create the same object
twice they will not have the same reference like String literals would, even though the initialization list is defined
and known at compile time. Arrays are also mutable, we can modify the individual elements of the array, while we can not
modify the length, to do that a new one has to be created instead.

```java
    int month_days[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
    int month_days2[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
    assert(month_days == month_days2) // false, they are not like string literals, no interning for initialization lists
```

```
The elements in the array allocated by new will automatically be initialized to:
    -   zero for numeric types,
    -   null for reference types
    -   false for booleans types
```

Multidimensional arrays can be defined by stacking square brackets, in this case as many as we want, there is really no
limit to how many dimensions we create or define for an array where the minimum is 1

```java
    int array0[][] = new int[][]; // invalid, compile time error, there is nothing to `new` here, no size specified
    int array1[][] = new int[4][5]; // 4 rows, by 5 columns, initialized at 0, the elements per row are fixed to 5
    int array2[][] = new int[4][]; // 4 rows, but each row points to null, have to manually initialize the second array per row
    int array3[][][] = new int[4][][]; // 4 rows, but the inner dimensions are not initialized yet, do this manually per row
    array3[0] = new int[1][1] // the 0-th row is initialized to a two-dim array with sizes 1x1
```

Initialization lists for multi dimensional arrays are just like regular ones, where each entry is a list itself, and
`interning is NOT done` !

```java
    int array[][] = {
        { 0*0, 1*0, 2*0, 3*0 },
        { 0*1, 1*1, 2*1, 3*1 },
        { 0*2, 1*2, 2*2, 3*2 },
        { 0*3, 1*3, 2*3, 3*3 }
    }
```

Alternate declaration syntax such as `type[] var-name`, allows us to declare multiple arrays on the same line with the
following example

```java
    int nums[], nums2[], nums3[]; // all variables declared on this line are arrays
    int[] nums, nums2, nums3; // all variables declared on this line are arrays
    int nums, nums2[], nums3; // only the nums2 on this line is actually an array
```
