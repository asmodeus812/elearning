<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>What is it ? SSH is the Secure Shell, a popular powerful software
based approach to network security. Whenever data is sent by a computer
to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When the data reaches its
intended recipient, SSH automatically decrypts it. The result is
transparent encryption: users can work normally unaware that their
communications are safely encrypted on the network. In addition, SSH
uses modern secure encryption algorithms and is effective enough to be
found within mission critical application at major corporations.</p>
<p>SSH has a client/server architecture. An SSH server program typically
installed and run by a system administrator, accepts or rejects incoming
connections to its host computer. Users then run SSH client programs,
typically on other computers to make requests of the SSH server, such as
- logging in, sending files, or executing commands. All communication
between the clients and the servers are security encrypted and protected
from modification.</p>
<p>Our description is simplified but should give you a general idea of
what SSH is and does. An SSH based product might include clients,
servers or both. Unix products generally container both clients and
servers, those on other platforms are usually just clients, though
Windows based servers do exist.</p>
<p>If you are a Unix user, think of SSH as a secure form of the Unix
r-commands, <code>rsb</code> (remote shell), <code>rlogin</code> (remote
login) and <code>rcp</code> (remote copy). In fact the original SSH for
Unix includes the similarly named commands <code>ssb</code>,
<code>scp</code> and <code>slogin</code>, as secure, drop in
replacements for the r-commands</p>
<h2 id="what-ssh-is-not">What SSH is NOT</h2>
<p>Although SSH stands for Secure Shell, it is not a true shell in the
sense of the Unix <code>Bourne shell</code> (bash) and
<code>C shell</code> (sh). It is not a command interpreter nor does it
provide wildcard expansion command history and so forth. Rather, SSH
creates a channel for running a shell on a remote computer in the manner
of the Unix <code>rsb</code> command. With end-to-end encryption between
the local and remote computer. SSH is also not a complete security
solution - but then again nothing is. It will not protect computers from
active break-in attempts or denial of service attacks, and it wont
eliminate other hazards such as viruses. It does however provide a
robust and user friendly encryption and authentication.</p>
<h2 id="the-ssh-protocol">The SSH protocol</h2>
<p>SSH is a protocol first and foremost, not a product, It is a
specification of how to conduct secure communication over a network. The
SSH protocol covers authentication, encryption and the integrity of data
transmitted over a network.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Authentication - reliably determines someone’s identity. If you
try to log into an account on a remote computer, SSH asks for digital
proof of your identify. If you pass the test, you may log in; otherwise
SSH rejects the connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Encryption - scrambles data so it is unintelligible expect to the
intended recipient. This protects your data as it passes over the
network.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrity - guarantees the data traverling over the network
arrives unaltered. If a third party captures and modifies you data in
transit SSH detects this fact.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, SSH, makes network connections between computers with
strong guarantees that the parties on both ends of the connection are
genuine. It also ensures that any data passing over these connections
arrives unmodified and unread by eavesdroppers</p>
<h2 id="protocols-products-clients-and-confusion">Protocols, Products,
Clients and Confusion</h2>
<p>SSH based products are those that implement the SSH protocol, for
many flavors of UNIX, Windows, Macintosh and other operating systems.
Bot freely distributable and commercial products are available. The
first SSH product, was created for Unix, was simply called SSH. This
causes confusion because SSH is also the name of the protocol. Some
people called it Unix SSH, but other unix based implementations are not
available so the name is not satisfactory.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-ssh-features">Overview of SSH features</h2>
<p>As already mentioned SSH mostly revolves around secure login, data
transmission and integrity</p>
<h3 id="secure-login">Secure login</h3>
<p>Let us suppose that we have accounts on several computers on the
Internet. Typically you connect from a home PC to your ISP, and then use
a telnet program to log into your accounts on other computers.
Unfortunately telnet transmits your username and password in plaintext,
over the internet, where a malicious third party can intercept them.
Additionally your entire telnet session is readable by a network
snooper. SSH completely solves this problem. Rather than running the
insecure telnet program and protocol, you run the SSH program ssh, to
login to the remote account or computer. This is done with the following
<code>ssh -l smith host.example.com -p 22</code></p>
<p>The clients authenticates you to the remote computer’s SSH server
using an encrypted connection meaning that your username and password
are encrypted before they leave the local machine. The SSH server then
logs you in and your entire login session is encrypted as it travels
between the client and server. Because the encryption is transparent you
will not notice any differences between telnet and the SSH client.</p>
<h2 id="secure-data-transfer">Secure data transfer</h2>
<p>Suppose you have two computers or machines on the internet and wish
to transfer files between them, The file contains trade secrets about
your business, however that must be kept from prying eyes. A traditional
file-transfer program such as ftp, rcp or even email, does not provide a
secure solution. A third party can intercept and read packets as it as
they travel over the network. To get around this problem you can encrypt
the file on the first machine, with a program, then send it over via
traditional means, and decrypt the file on the second machine. Using
SSH, the file can be transferred, securely between the machines with a
single secure copy command - <code>scp myfile user@host.com</code>. When
transmitted by scp the file is automatically encrypted as it leaves the
first machine, and decrypted as it arrives on the second machine</p>
<h2 id="secure-remote-execution">Secure remote execution</h2>
<p>Suppose you are a system admin who needs to run the same command on
many computers. You would like to view the active processes for each
user on four different computers. On a local area network using the Unix
command /usr/ucb/w. Traditionally one could use <code>rsb</code>,
assuming that the <code>rsb</code> daemon, <code>rsbd</code> is
configured properly on the remote computers.
<code>rsh $machine /usr/usb/w</code>. This will work, however it is
insecure, The results of executing the <code>/usr/usb/</code> binary are
transmitted over the network as plaintext. If you consider this
information sensitive, the risk might be unacceptable, Worse the
<code>rsb</code> authentication mechanism is very insecure, and easily
subverted. Instead using the <code>ssb</code> command one can do -
<code>ssb $machine /usr/ucb/w</code>. Where the <code>$machine</code> is
a <code>sh</code> variable which represents the host name of the machine
to connect to, that could be a FQDN, or an IP address.</p>
<p>The syntax for both commands is nearly identical and the visible
output is identical, but under the hood, the command and its results are
encrypted, sent, and then decrypted, and strong authentication
techniques will be used to ensure secure user login.</p>
<h2 id="keys-and-agents">Keys and agents</h2>
<p>Suppose you have accounts on many computers on a network. For
security reasons you prefer different passwords on all accounts, but
remembering so many passwords is difficult. It is also a security
problem in itself. The more often you type a password, the more likely
you mistakenly type it in the wrong place. SSH has various
authentication mechanisms and the most secure is based on keys rather
than passwords. Keys are a small blob of bits that uniquely identifies
an SSH user. For security a key is kept encrypted, and it may be used
only after entering a secret pass phrase to decrypt it.</p>
<p>Using keys together with a program called an authentication agent,
SSH can authenticate you to all computers accounts securely without
requiring you to memorize many different passwords, or enter them
repeatedly. The way it works is like that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In advance (only once) you place files called public key files
into the remote computers. These enable you to access the remote
machines. These public keys identify <code>you as you</code> on the
remote machines, you would later try to access</p></li>
<li><p>On your local machine, invoke the ssh-agent program which runs in
the background. This daemon will hold the keys <code>in memory</code>,
and only needs to be started once, when you login to your local machine
for the day, this can be automated on most Unix systems, using
<code>services</code>, or other tools such as
<code>systemd</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the key (or keys) you will need during your login session.
These <code>have to correspond to the keys added in step one</code> to
the remote machines, they will be used to authenticate you when a
connection is made.</p></li>
<li><p>Load the keys into the agent, with the
<code>ssh-add program</code>. This requires knowledge or each key’s
secret passphrase in order to load it into the ssh-agent daemon, this is
however done only once and until the agent daemon works, the keys are
loaded</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At this point you have an ssh-agent program running on your local
machine, holding your secret keys, in memory. You are now done. You have
password less access to all your remote accounts that contain your
public key files. Say goodbye to all the tedium of retyping passwords.
The setup lasts until you log out from the local machine or terminate
the ssh-agent</p>
<h2 id="access-control">Access control</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to permit another person to use your computer
account but only for certain purposes, for example while you are out of
town you would like your secretary to read your email but not to do
anything else in your accounts. With SSH you can give your secretary
access to your account without revealing or changing your password, and
with only the ability to run the email program. No system administrator
privileges are required so setup this restricted access.</p>
<h2 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h2>
<p>SSH can increase the security of other TCP based apps such as telnet
ftp and the X Window subsystem. A technique called port forwarding or
tunneling re routes, TCP connection to pass through an SSH connection
transparently encrypting it end to end, Port forwarding can also pass
such apps through network firewalls that otherwise prevent their use.
Suppose you are logged into a remote machine away from work and want to
access the internal news server at your office. The network is connected
to the internet but a network firewall blocks incoming connections to
the most ports particularly port 119 the news post. The firewall does
allow incoming SSH connections however, since the SSH protocol is secure
enough that even that network, with its rabidly paranoid system
administrators trust it. SSH can establish a secure tunnel on an
arbitrary local TCP port say port 3002 to the news port on the remote
host, the command might look a bit cryptic at this early stage but here
it is - <code>ssh -L 302:localhost:119 news.yoyodyne.com</code> This
says <code>ssh</code> please establish a secure connection from TCP port
3002 on my local machine to TCP port 119 the news port on the server -
news.yoyodyne.com, So in order to securely configure your news reading
program to connect to port 3002 on your local machine. The secure tunnel
created by ssh automatically communicates with the news server on that
host, and the news traffic passing through the tunnel is protected by
encryption.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-ssh">History of SSH</h2>
<p><code>SSH1</code> and the SSH-1 protocol were developed in 1995, by a
researched at the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. After
his university network was the victim of password sniffing atatck
earlier that year, he whipped up <code>SSH1</code> for himself. When
beta versions started gaining attention however he realized that his
security product could be put to wider use. In July 1995
<code>SSH1</code> was released to the public as free software with
source code, permitting people to copy and use the program without cost,
by the end of hte year and estimated 20k users in 50 countries had
adopted <code>SSH1</code> and he was fending off 150 email messages per
day requesting support. In response he founded the SSH communications
security, Ltd (<code>SCS</code>).</p>
<p>Also in 1995 Yolonen documented the <code>SSH1</code> protocol as an
internet engineering task force (<code>IETF</code>) internet draft which
essentially described the operation of the <code>SSH1</code> software
after the fact. It was somewhat ad-hoc protocol with a number of
problems and limitations discovered as the software grew in popularity.
These problems could not be fixed without losing backward compatibility
so in 1996 <code>SCS</code> introduced a new major version of the
protocol SSH 2.0 or <code>SSH2</code> that incorporates new algorithms
and is incompatible with <code>SSH1</code>. In response, the
<code>IETF</code> formed a working group called the Secure Shell to
standardize the protocol and guide its development in the public
interest. The working groups submitted the first internet draft for the
<code>SSH2</code> protocol in February 1997</p>
<p>In 1998 <code>SCS</code> released the software product SSH secure
shell - based on the superior <code>SSH2</code> protocol. However
<code>SSH2</code> did not replace <code>SSH1</code> in the field for two
reasons. First <code>SSH2</code> was missing a number of useful
practical features and configuration options of <code>SSH1</code>.
Second <code>SSH2</code> had a more restrictive license. The original
<code>SSH1</code> had been freely available from Ylonen and the Helsinki
University of Technology. Newer versions of <code>SSH1</code> from
<code>SCS</code> were still freely available for most uses even in
commercial settings, as long as the softwaer was not directly sold for
profit or offered as a service to customers. <code>SSH2</code> on the
other hand was a commercial product, allowing gratis use only for
qualifying education and non profit entities. As a result when
<code>SSH2</code> first appeared most existing <code>SSH1</code> users
saw few advantages to <code>SSH2</code> and continued to use
<code>SSH1</code>.<code>SSH1</code> is still the most widely deployed
version on the internet even though the <code>SSH2</code> is a better
and more secure protocol.</p>
<p>The situation promises to change, however as a result of two
developments, a loosening of the <code>SSH2</code> license and the
appearance of free <code>SSH2</code> implementations. Products like
OpenSSH are gaining prominence. Though many people have contributed to
it OpenSSH largely the work of a single software developer. It supports
both <code>SSH1</code> and <code>SSH2</code> in a single set of
programs, whereas the products provided by Ylonen <code>SSH1</code> and
<code>SSH2</code> have separate executables. While OpenSSH was developed
under OpennBSD, it has been ported successfully to Linux, Solaris and
other operating systems, in tight synchronization with the main
releases. Although OpenSSH is relatively new and missing some features
present in <code>SSH1</code> and <code>SSH2</code> it is developing
rapidly and promises to be a major SSH flavor in the near future.</p>
<p>At present time, development of <code>SSH1</code> has ceased except
for important bug fixes while development of <code>SSH2</code> and
OpenSSH remains stable and active. Other SSH implementations, notably
the commercial versions of <code>SSH1</code> and <code>SSH2</code>
maintained and sold by <code>FSecure Corporation</code> and numerous
ports and original products for the PC Macintosh and other operating
systems. It is estimated there are over two million SSH users worldwide,
including hundreds of thousands of registered users of the
<code>SCS</code> products</p>
<h2 id="related-technologies">Related Technologies</h2>
<p>SSH is popular and convenient but we certainly do not claim it is the
ultimate security solution for all networks, authentication, encryption
and network security originated way before SSH and have been
incorporated int o many other systems.</p>
<h3 id="rsb-suite">RSB Suite</h3>
<p>The unix programs <code>rsb rlogin and rcp</code> collectively known
as the r commands are the direct ancestors of the <code>SSH1</code>
clients <code>ssh slogin and scp</code>. The user interfaces and visible
functionality are nearly identical to their ssh counterparts expect that
ssh clients are secure. The r commands in contrast do not encrypt their
connections and have are weak and easily subverted authentication
model.</p>
<p>An r-command server relies on two mechanism for security, a network
naming service and the notion of privileged TCP ports. Upon receiving a
connection from a client the server obtain the network address of the
originating host and translates it into a hostname. This hostname must
be present in a configuration file on the server typically
<code>/etc/hots.quiv</code>, for the server to permit access. The server
also checks that the source TCP port number is in the range of 1-1024
since these port numbers can be used only by the UNIX superuser or root.
I the connection passes both checks the server believes it is talking to
a trusted program on a trusted host and logs in the client as whatever
user is requested.</p>
<p>These two security checks are easily subverted. The translation of
network address to a hostname is done by a naming service such as a DNS
service. Most implementations have security holes presenting
opportunities to trick the server into trusting a host it should not.
Then a remote user can log into someone else’s account on the server
simply by having the same username.</p>
<p>Likewise blind trust in privileged TCP ports represents a serious
security risk. A cracker who gains root privilege on a trusted machine
can simply run a tailored version of the RSB client and log in as any
user on the server host. Overall reliance on these port number is no
longer trustworthy in a world of desktop computers, whose users have
administrative access as a matter of course or whose operating systems
do not support multiple users or privileges .</p>
<p>If user databases on trusted hosts were always synchornized with the
server, installation of privileged</p>
