<h1 id="java">Java</h1>
<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
programmers write once, run anywhere (<code>WORA</code>), meaning that
compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to
<code>bytecode</code> that can run on any Java virtual machine
(<code>JVM</code>) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
facilities than either of them.</p>
<h2 id="the-history">The History</h2>
<p>Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth,
Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It took
18 months to develop the first working version. This language was
initially called “Oak,” but was renamed “Java” in 1995. Between the
initial implementation of Oak in the fall of 1992 and the public
announcement of Java in the spring of 1995</p>
<p>Instead, the primary motivation was the need for a
platform-independent (that is, architecture-neutral) language that could
be used to create software to be embedded in various consumer electronic
devices, such as microwave ovens and remote controls. As you can
probably guess, many different types of CPUs are used as controllers.
The trouble with C and C++ (and most other languages) is that they are
designed to be compiled for a specific target.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-world">Changing the world</h2>
<p>Applets - An applet is a special kind of Java program that is
designed to be transmitted over the Internet and automatically executed
by a Java-compatible web browser. Furthermore, an applet is downloaded
on demand, without further interaction with the user. If the user clicks
a link that contains an applet, the applet will be automatically
downloaded and run in the browser. Applets are intended to be small
programs. They are typically used to display data provided by the
server, handle user input, or provide simple functions, such as a loan
calculator, that execute locally, rather than on the server. In essence,
the applet allows some functionality to be moved from the server to the
client.</p>
<p>Servlets - Java on the Server Side As useful as applets can be, they
are just one half of the client/server equation. Not long after the
initial release of Java, it became obvious that Java would also be
useful on the server side. The result was the servlet. A servlet is a
small program that executes on the server. Just as applets dynamically
extend the functionality of a web browser, servlets dynamically extend
the functionality of a web server. Thus, with the advent of the servlet,
Java spanned both sides of the client/server connection.</p>
<p>Security - Java achieved this protection by confining an applet to
the Java execution environment and not allowing it access to other parts
of the computer. (You will see how this is accomplished shortly.) The
ability to download applets with confidence that no harm will be done
and that no security will be breached may have been the single most
innovative aspect of Java</p>
<p>Portability - Portability is a major aspect of the Internet because
there are many different types of computers and operating systems
connected to it. If a Java program were to be run on virtually any
computer connected to the Internet, there needed to be some way to
enable that program to execute on different systems.</p>
<h2 id="byte-code-magic">Byte code magic</h2>
<p>The output of a Java compiler is not executable code. Rather, it is
bytecode. Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to
be executed by the Java run-time system, which is called the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM). In essence, the original JVM was designed as an
interpreter for bytecode. This may come as a bit of a surprise since
many modern languages are designed to be compiled into executable code
because of performance concerns. However, the fact that a Java program
is executed by the JVM helps solve the major problems associated with
web-based programs. Here is why.</p>
<p>Translating a Java program into bytecode makes it much easier to run
a program in a wide variety of environments because only the JVM needs
to be implemented for each platform. Once the run-time package exists
for a given system, any Java program can run on it. Remember, although
the details of the JVM will differ from platform to platform, all
understand the same Java bytecode. If a Java program were compiled to
native code, then different versions of the same program would have to
exist for each type of CPU connected to the Internet. This is, of
course, not a feasible solution.</p>
<p>The fact that a Java program is executed by the JVM also helps to
make it secure.</p>
<p>Although Java was designed as an interpreted language, there is
nothing about Java that prevents on-the-fly compilation of bytecode into
native code in order to boost performance. For this reason, the HotSpot
technology was introduced not long after Java’s initial release. HotSpot
provides a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for bytecode. When a JIT compiler
is part of the JVM, selected portions of bytecode are compiled into
executable code in real time, on a piece-by-piece, demand basis. It is
important to understand that it is not practical to compile an entire
Java program into executable code all at once, because Java performs
various run-time checks that can be done only at run time. Instead, a
JIT compiler compiles code as it is needed, during execution.</p>

<h2 id="java-versions">Java Versions</h2>
<p>Here is a brief synopses of the major features in each version of
java, the release of java 5 is what would mark the language’s powers in
the new age of programming</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Java 1.0 (1996) - Initial release of Java. Introduced basic
language features, AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), Applets, JVM, Garbage
Collection, and multithreading support.</p></li>
<li><p>Java 1.1 (1997) - Significant update with event handling model
(delegation event model), inner classes, JavaBeans, JDBC (Java Database
Connectivity), RMI (Remote Method Invocation), and deprecation of some
methods from 1.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Java 1.2 (Java 2) (1998) - Major update marking the beginning of
“modern Java”. Introduced Swing GUI toolkit, Collections Framework, JIT
Compiler integration into JVM, Java Plug-in, and Security
Enhancements.</p></li>
<li><p>Java 1.3 (2000) - Performance improvements, HotSpot JVM became
the default, and added JavaSound API. Minor updates to collections and
networking.</p></li>
<li><p>Java 1.4 (2002) - Introduced assertions, regular expressions, NIO
(New Input/Output), Java Web Start, logging API, and XML parsing.
Focused on better core language support and more robust I/O.</p></li>
<li><p>Java 1.5 (Java 5) (2004) - Introduced Generics, enhanced for
loop, autoboxing/unboxing, varargs, annotations, enumerations, and the
concurrency utilities package. Renamed as Java 5.0 to reflect major
updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Java 1.6 (Java 6) (2006) - Focused on performance improvements,
added Scripting API, Compiler API, Web Services support (JAX-WS), and
enhancements to JDBC 4.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Java 1.7 (Java 7) (2011) - Introduced try-with-resources for
better exception handling, diamond operator (&lt;&gt;), NIO.2 (enhanced
file I/O), Fork/Join framework, switch statements with strings, and
improvements to the JVM (invokedynamic bytecode).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the very important release of Java J2SE 5, it was revolutionary.
Unlike most of the previous Java upgrades, which offered important, but
measured improvements, J2SE 5 fundamentally expanded the scope, power,
and range of the language.</p>
<p>The importance of these new features is reflected in the use of the
version number “5.” The next version number for Java would normally have
been 1.5. However, the new features were so significant that a shift
from 1.4 to 1.5 just didn’t seem to express the magnitude of the change.
Instead, Sun elected to increase the version number to 5 as a way of
emphasizing that a major event was taking place. Thus, it was named J2SE
5, and the developer’s kit was called JDK 5. However, in order to
maintain consistency, Sun decided to use 1.5 as its internal version
number, which is also referred to as the developer version number. The
“5” in J2SE 5 is called the product version number.</p>
<p>This marks a significant milestone in the development of the language
and it’s runtime, from then on the major version will be kept as a Java
SE 5,6,7 etc. But the development version number format of 1._release_
would be kept up until the release of Java 8 as Java SE 1.8</p>
<p>The Java SE 7 was the first major release of Java since Sun
Microsystems was acquired by Oracle. Java SE 7 made several additions to
the Java API library. Two of the most important were the enhancements to
the NIO Framework and the addition of the Fork/Join Framework. NIO
(which originally stood for New I/O) was added to Java in version 1.4.
However, the changes added by Java SE 7 fundamentally expanded its
capabilities. So significant were the changes, that the term NIO.2 is
often used.</p>
<h2 id="java-features">Java Features</h2>
<h3 id="java-beans">Java Beans</h3>
<p>Set of conventions for creating reusable software components in Java.
They are used to encapsulate many objects into a single object (the
bean)</p>
<ul>
<li>Properties: JavaBeans use properties to store and retrieve data.
These properties are accessed through getter and setter methods. For
example:</li>
<li>Default Constructor: JavaBeans must have a no-argument (default)
constructor, which allows for easy instantiation without needing to
provide parameters.</li>
<li>Serializable: JavaBeans should implement the Serializable interface,
which allows the bean to be easily serialized and deserialized. This is
useful for storing or transmitting bean instances.</li>
<li>Getter and Setter Methods: JavaBeans follow a naming convention for
accessor methods. Getter methods retrieve property values and start with
get followed by the property name (e.g., getName),</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="awt-abstract-window-toolkit">AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)</h3>
<p>AWT is the original Java GUI toolkit introduced in JDK 1.0. It
provides a set of native, platform-dependent GUI components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Components: Includes basic components such as buttons, checkboxes,
labels, text fields, and more.</li>
<li>Rendering: AWT components are rendered by the native OS, which means
they look like native components on different platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="swing-swing-beyond-awt">Swing (Swing beyond AWT)</h3>
<p>Swing is a more advanced GUI toolkit introduced in JDK 1.2 as part of
Java 2. It builds on AWT but provides a richer set of components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Components: Includes enhanced components like JButton, JLabel,
JTable, JTree, JList, and many more, offering greater functionality and
customization.</li>
<li>Rendering: Swing components are rendered by Java and do not rely on
the native OS. This provides a consistent look and feel across different
platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jdbc-java-database-connectivity">JDBC (Java Database
Connectivity)</h3>
<p>Is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with
relational databases. It provides a standard interface for connecting to
databases, executing SQL queries, and retrieving results</p>
<ul>
<li>Database Connectivity: JDBC enables Java applications to connect to
a wide variety of relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
using a database driver.</li>
<li>SQL Execution: Through JDBC, you can execute SQL statements, such as
queries (SELECT), updates (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and more complex
commands.</li>
<li>Result Handling: JDBC allows you to process the results returned by
SQL queries, including navigating through results, extracting data, and
handling errors.</li>
<li>Transaction Management: JDBC provides support for transaction
management, allowing you to commit or rollback transactions to ensure
data integrity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rmi-remote-method-invocation">RMI (Remote Method
Invocation)</h3>
<p>Is a Java API that allows a Java program to invoke methods on an
object located on a different Java Virtual Machine (JVM), whether it’s
on the same machine or across a network, can communicate over the
Internet</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote Communication: Allows objects to communicate over a network,
enabling the development of distributed applications.</li>
<li>Object Serialization: Transmits object states between JVMs using
Java’s built-in serialization mechanism.</li>
<li>Stubs and Skeletons: Clients use stubs to interact with remote
objects, while the server side uses skeletons (deprecated in recent
versions) to handle communication.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-java-sound-api">The Java Sound API</h3>
<p>Provides a set of classes and interfaces for handling audio in Java
applications</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows developers to work with audio data for tasks such as
playback, recording, and processing of audio.</li>
<li>Provides access to audio system resources and manages audio data. It
includes classes for audio mixing, playback, and recording.</li>
<li>javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem: A central class that provides
methods for obtaining and managing audio line objects, including mixers,
data lines, and audio input/output lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="java-web-start">Java Web Start</h3>
<p>Was a technology developed by Sun Microsystems (later Oracle) that
allowed Java applications to be launched and run over a network from a
web browser. It was introduced in Java 1.4 and was part of the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE).</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment: Simplified the deployment of Java applications by
enabling users to launch Java programs directly from a web browser or
desktop shortcut without needing to install them manually.</li>
<li>Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP): Used JNLP files to describe how
to launch and manage the application. The JNLP file is an XML file that
includes information such as the application’s main class, required
libraries, and resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>How Java Web Start Worked</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching: When a user clicked on a link to a Java Web Start
application, the JNLP file was downloaded and read by the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE).</li>
<li>Downloading: Java Web Start downloaded the application’s JAR files
and other resources specified in the JNLP file.</li>
<li>Caching: The application was cached locally on the user’s machine to
improve performance on subsequent launches.</li>
<li>Running: The JRE launched the application in its own process,
providing a user interface as specified by the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="java-logging-api">Java Logging API</h3>
<p>Also known as the java.util.logging package. This API provides a
standardized mechanism and the actual concrete implementation for
logging information in Java applications</p>
<p>Relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java Logging API: Provides a concrete implementation of logging
within the Java standard library. It’s a built-in logging framework with
its own set of classes and methods for logging messages.</li>
<li>SLF4J: Acts as a facade or abstraction layer. It provides a common
API that allows you to switch between different logging implementations
without changing your logging code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java Logging API: Directly used by developers to create loggers and
manage log messages.</li>
<li>SLF4J: Used by developers to write logging code in a generic way,
which can then be routed to different logging frameworks, including the
Java Logging API, Log4j, Logback, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-original-io">The original I/O</h3>
<p>API in Java, introduced in Java 1.0, is part of the java.io package.
This API provides classes and interfaces for performing input and output
operations, primarily with files, streams, and data</p>

<p>Incoming HTTP Request Over a Socket Client Request:</p>
<p>A client (e.g., a web browser or another application) sends an HTTP
request to a server. This request is transmitted over the network using
the HTTP protocol. Socket Communication:</p>
<p>The HTTP request is sent over a <code>TCP/IP</code> connection. This
involves creating a socket connection between the client and the server.
On the server side, a socket is an endpoint for communication. The web
server listens on a specific port (e.g., port 80 for HTTP or 443 for
HTTPS) for incoming connections. Web Server Listening:</p>
<p>The web server (e.g., Apache HTTP Server, Nginx) listens for incoming
connections on its configured port. When a request arrives, the server
accepts the socket connection and reads the incoming HTTP request data
from the socket. 2. Request Handling by the Web Server Parsing the
Request:</p>
<p>The web server parses the HTTP request to extract the request method
(GET, POST, etc.), URL, headers, and body (if present). Routing the
Request:</p>
<p>The server determines how to handle the request based on the URL and
method. This may involve serving static content (like HTML files) or
forwarding the request to an application server for dynamic content.
Forwarding to Application Server (if needed):</p>
<p>For dynamic content or web services, the web server forwards the
request to a <code>Java EE</code> application server. This can be done
using various methods, including proxying or direct communication. 3.
Application Server Processing Receiving the Request:</p>
<p>The application server (e.g., Apache Tomcat, JBoss EAP) receives the
request from the web server. This server is capable of handling
<code>Java EE</code> components. Request Dispatching:</p>
<p>The application server dispatches the request to the appropriate
component based on the configuration. For example, it might route the
request to a <code>servlet</code> or a web service. 4. Web Service
Invocation Service Locator:</p>
<p>If the request is for a web service, the application server locates
the appropriate service endpoint based on the request URL and method.
Processing the Request:</p>
<p>SOAP Web Services (<code>JAX-WS</code>): <code>WSDL</code>: The
service is described using <code>WSDL</code> (Web Services Description
Language). The server uses the <code>WSDL</code> to understand the
request structure and determine how to process it. Service Endpoint: The
application server uses <code>JAX-WS</code> to handle the SOAP request.
It invokes the appropriate service method based on the SOAP message.
<code>RESTful</code> Web Services (<code>JAX-RS</code>): Annotations:
<code>RESTful</code> services use annotations to map HTTP methods to
Java methods. The server uses <code>JAX-RS</code> to find the
appropriate resource method. Processing: The application server
processes the request, possibly involving business logic or database
interactions, and prepares a response. Business Logic Execution:</p>
<p>The web service might interact with other components like
<code>EJBs</code> (Enterprise <code>JavaBeans</code>) or data access
layers to perform the necessary business logic. 5. Generating and
Sending the Response Response Preparation:</p>
<p>The web service generates a response based on the request. For SOAP
services, this involves creating a SOAP message. For
<code>RESTful</code> services, it might be <code>JSON</code> or XML.
Returning the Response:</p>
<p>The response is sent back to the web server, which then forwards it
to the client. The response includes the HTTP status code, headers, and
body content. Socket Closure:</p>
<p>Once the response is sent, the socket connection is closed if it is
not kept alive for further requests.</p>
<h2 id="release-cycle">Release Cycle</h2>
<p>There are several reasons for the Six-Month Release Cycle Increased
Agility - The rapid pace of technological advancement and evolving
programming paradigms necessitate a more agile approach to language
updates. A six-month cycle allows for quicker iterations on features and
improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feature-Driven Releases: By allowing smaller, more frequent
updates, Java can incorporate new features, enhancements, and fixes
without waiting for a major version release. This means developers can
access improvements more frequently.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on Quality: The smaller scope of each release helps
maintain quality. Instead of waiting for a large number of features to
accumulate, each release can focus on a specific set of enhancements or
bug fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>Community Engagement: Regular releases encourage community
involvement. Developers can provide feedback on new features more
frequently, and their input can be integrated into upcoming
releases.</p></li>
<li><p>Predictability: A consistent release schedule helps organizations
plan their upgrade paths and incorporate new features into their
development processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Future of the Six-Month Cycle As for whether this cycle will continue
indefinitely, several points are worth noting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sustainability: The six-month cycle has been well-received and
has proven sustainable over several years. There is no official
indication from Oracle or the <code>OpenJDK</code> community that they
plan to change this schedule in the near future.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Improvement: The Java community regularly evaluates
the release process and adapts as needed. If the community or the
demands of modern software development change significantly, adjustments
to the release cadence might be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Feature Proposals: The community continues to propose new
features through the <code>JEP</code> (JDK Enhancement-Proposal)
process. This iterative improvement mechanism fits well with a six-month
release model.</p></li>
